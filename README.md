***Result***<br>

* Oregon and California had Hot Pepperoni Feast as most the sold pizza, Arizona and Idaho had Chicken Suya as the most sold pizza and BBQ Philly Steak as 2nd most sold pizza, and Nevada 
  had Pepperoni Feast as most sold pizza
* Total sales accross all states were between 39k to 37k except Idaho which had 36k as total sales
* All stores across states met target sales when sales where combined otherwise stores in all 5 states fell short to meet target sales

\
***Recomnendation***<br>
* CEO should consult with store managers to find pattren change in pizza perference between Oregon and California stores, and Arizona and Idaho stores because 2nd most sold pizzas are 
  differnet for both Oregon and California stores
* Even though Idaho store sales were short by 1k increasing Hot Pepperoni sale will put the store in same performance category
* CEO should introduce weekly sales to meet target sales or find better customer attraction methods<br><br>
